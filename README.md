# Learning Swift through Advent of Code

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Swift-red.svg)](https://swift.org)

Daily programming puzzles at [Advent of Code](<https://adventofcode.com/>), by
[Eric Wastl](<http://was.tl/>). This project was created from a small example starter project for
building Advent of Code solutions using Swift.

## Usage

Swift comes with Xcode, or you can [install it](https://www.swift.org/install/)
on a supported macOS, Linux, or Windows platform. 

If you're using Xcode, you can open this project by choosing File / Open and
select the parent directory. 

If you prefer the command line, you can run the test suite with `swift test`,
and run the output with `swift run`.

If you're using Visual Studio Code to edit, you might find these Swift
extensions useful:

- [Swift](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang)
  (provides core language edit / debug / test features)
- [apple-swift-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-apple-swift-format)
  (supports the [swift-format](https://github.com/apple/swift-format) package)

## Challenges

The challenges assume three files (replace 00 with the day of the challenge).

- `Data/Day00.txt`: the input data provided for the challenge
- `Sources/Day00.swift`: the code to solve the challenge
- `Tests/Day00.swift`: any unit tests that you want to include

To start a new day's challenge, make a copy of these files and update as
necessary. The `AdventOfCode.swift` file controls which day's challenge is run
with `swift run`. By default that runs the most recent challenge in the package.

To supply command line arguments use `swift run AdventOfCode`. For example,
`swift run -c release AdventOfCode --benchmark 3` builds the binary with full
optimizations, and benchmarks the challenge for day 3.

## Linting and Formatting

Challenge source code can be linted and formatted automatically using the
included dependency on `swift-format`.

Lint source code with the following command:

```shell
$ swift package lint-source-code
```

Format source code with the following command:

```shell
$ swift package format-source-code
Plugin ‚ÄòFormat Source Code‚Äô wants permission to write to the package directory.
Stated reason: ‚ÄúThis command formats the Swift source files‚Äù.
Allow this plugin to write to the package directory? (yes/no)
```

To avoid the interactive prompt when formatting source code, use the 
`--allow-writing-to-package-directory` flag.
 
```shell
$ swift package format-source-code --allow-writing-to-package-directory
```

swift-format will use the built-in default style to lint and format code. A
`.swift-format` configuration file can be used to customize the style used, see
[Configuration](https://github.com/apple/swift-format/blob/main/Documentation/Configuration.md)
for more details. 

## Challenge Submissions

***Spoilers lie ahead -- Read at Your Own Risk***

### Day 01

This was a good real-world introduction to Swift. It challenged my knowledge 
of the syntax, types, and some of the String and Substring methods (there are
so many!).

There was a twist in part two of today's challenge, which was not very well 
documented. As a result, the second half took quite a while, and I had to
come up with a strange solution to avoid a complete refactor of my approach.

It's always hard to learn a new language, I knew I could have solved this much
faster if I were using a familiar language, such as TypeScript. However, I am
committing myself to complete this year's advent in Swift, as it's going to be
a great way to get more familiar with it. Hopefully by day 24 I'm no longer 
struggling with little things like creating Regexes or converting Substrings to 
Strings üòÖ.

Today's challenge also reminded me of the importance of tests, not just for
catching bugs, but for creating smaller, intentional sets of data to test out
important aspects of your code. Tests were instrumental for ensuring I properly
caught the quirk in Part 2's computation.
